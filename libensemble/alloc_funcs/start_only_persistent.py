    """
    This allocation function will give simulation work if possible, but
    otherwise start up to one persistent generator. By default, evaluation
    results are given back to the generator once all generated points have
    been returned from the simulation evaluation. If alloc_specs['user']['async_return']
    is set to True, then any returned points are given back to the generator.

    If the single persistent generator has exited, then ensemble shutdown is triggered.

    **User options**:

    To be provided in calling script: E.g., ``alloc_specs['user']['async_return'] = True``

    init_sample_size: int, optional
        Initial sample size - always return in batch. Default: 0

    async_return: boolean, optional
        Return results to gen as they come in (after sample). Default: False (batch return).

    active_recv_gen: boolean, optional
        Create gen in active receive mode. If True, the manager does not need to wait
        for a return from the generator before sending further returned points.
        Default: False

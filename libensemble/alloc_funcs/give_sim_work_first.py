    Decide what should be given to workers. This allocation function gives any
    available simulation work first, and only when all simulations are
    completed or running does it start (at most ``alloc_specs['user']['num_active_gens']``)
    generator instances.

    Allows for a ``alloc_specs['user']['batch_mode']`` where no generation
    work is given out unless all entries in ``H`` are returned.

    Allows for ``blocking`` of workers that are not active, for example, so
    their resources can be used for a different simulation evaluation.

    Can give points in highest priority, if ``'priority'`` is a field in ``H``.

    This is the default allocation function if one is not defined.
